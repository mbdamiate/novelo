# Standard Library — Novelo

Nov 10, 2026 · @Matheus Damiate

## 1. Overview

The standard library is a set of functions written in the language itself, on top of the core primitives. It is not part of the core: an implementation conformant to the core does not need to provide it, and the core tests do not depend on it.

The standard library is made of five libraries, in the sense of core section 8.9: `list`, `text`, `function`, `map` and `set`. Nothing is loaded before the program: a file imports the libraries it uses, such as `(import list)`, and only then sees their names. Imported with no prefix, the names are ordinary globals, and a program may redefine them. Imported with a prefix, as in `(import list l)`, they are bound as `l/map` and so on.

The reference definitions in section 4 are normative. The implementation MAY replace any of them with a native version, as long as the observable behavior is identical, including errors and the names each library binds.

**Version:** 0.4.0, draft, on top of core 0.7.0.

**Changes since 0.3.0.** The library `set` (sections 3 and 4.5), with `from-list`, `union`, `intersection`, `difference` and `subset?`, over the type Set of core 0.5.0. The other libraries are unchanged.

**Changes since 0.2.1.** The library `map` (sections 3 and 4.4), with `values`, `entries`, `from-entries`, `update`, `merge`, `map-values`, `filter-entries` and `fold-entries`. The other libraries are unchanged.

**Changes since 0.2.0.** The language is named Novelo (core 0.2.2); the cases in `stdlib-conformance.json` use `.nvl` file names. The libraries are unchanged.

**Changes since 0.1.0.** The library is split into `list`, `text` and `function`, each imported explicitly with `import`, instead of being loaded before every program.

## 2. General rules

- **Lists only.** The sequence functions of `list` and `text` take and return List. Strings and maps are not sequences here: passing one of them produces whatever error the primitive used internally produces, usually `:wrong-type`. The functions of `map` take and return Map, and those of `set` take and return Set; they traverse a map in the order of `keys` and a set in the order of `elements` (core section 9), so the order in which they call a function is unspecified, like those orders.
- **The function comes first and the collection last**, as in `(map f xs)` and `(map-values f m)`. This makes partial application with `partial` easier. `merge` takes two maps and `update` takes the key, the function and then the map.
- **Evaluation is eager.** Every function traverses the whole list and returns the finished result.
- **Constant memory.** Every function that traverses a list does so by tail recursion, so lists of any size are traversed in constant memory.
- **Helpers.** Since the core has no local recursion, some functions use helpers defined at the top level of their library: `take-step`, `range-step`, `merge-sorted` and `split-step`. They are bound by `import` like the other names, but they are not part of the interface: a program should not rely on them, and a native implementation MAY omit them.
- **Dependencies.** `text`, `function`, `map` and `set` import `list` (core 8.9). Importing any of them therefore also binds the names of `list` in the same context. The names of `list`, `map` and `set` are all different, so they can be imported together without a prefix.

## 3. Functions

| Library | Function | Usage | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list` | `reverse` | `(reverse xs)` | the elements in reverse order |
| `list` | `map` | `(map f xs)` | `f` applied to each element |
| `list` | `filter` | `(filter keep? xs)` | the elements for which `keep?` is true |
| `list` | `fold` | `(fold f initial xs)` | combines from first to last, calling `(f accumulator element)` |
| `list` | `append` | `(append xs ys)` | the elements of `xs` followed by those of `ys` |
| `list` | `take`, `drop` | `(take n xs)`, `(drop n xs)` | the first `n` elements, or what remains without them; negative `n` is an error |
| `list` | `range` | `(range start end)` | the integers from `start` up to before `end`; `()` if `start` is not less than `end` |
| `list` | `any?`, `every?` | `(any? matches? xs)` | `#true` if any, or all, satisfy it; they stop as soon as the answer is decided |
| `list` | `sort` | `(sort less? xs)` | the elements ordered by `less?`, stably |
| `text` | `split` | `(split separator text)` | List of the parts of `text`; an empty separator is an error |
| `text` | `join` | `(join separator parts)` | the strings in `parts` joined by `separator` |
| `function` | `partial` | `(partial f a …)` | the function that calls `f` with `a …` before the arguments it receives |
| `map` | `values` | `(values m)` | List of the values, in the order of `(keys m)` |
| `map` | `entries` | `(entries m)` | List of the pairs `(key value)`, in the order of `(keys m)` |
| `map` | `from-entries` | `(from-entries pairs)` | the map with each pair `(key value)`; a later pair replaces an earlier one with the same key; an element that is not a List of two elements is an error |
| `map` | `update` | `(update key f m)` | `m` with the value at `key` replaced by `f` applied to it; a missing key is an error, as in `get` |
| `map` | `merge` | `(merge m other)` | the pairs of both maps; for a key in both, the value of `other` |
| `map` | `map-values` | `(map-values f m)` | the same keys, with `f` applied to each value |
| `map` | `filter-entries` | `(filter-entries keep? m)` | the pairs for which `(keep? key value)` is true |
| `map` | `fold-entries` | `(fold-entries f initial m)` | combines the pairs in the order of `(keys m)`, calling `(f accumulator key value)` |
| `set` | `from-list` | `(from-list xs)` | the set of the elements of `xs`; repeated elements count once |
| `set` | `union` | `(union a b)` | the elements in `a` or in `b` |
| `set` | `intersection` | `(intersection a b)` | the elements in both `a` and `b` |
| `set` | `difference` | `(difference a b)` | the elements of `a` that are not in `b` |
| `set` | `subset?` | `(subset? a b)` | `#true` if every element of `a` is in `b` |

There is no `find`. To get the first element that satisfies a predicate, take `first` of the `filter` result after checking that it is not empty; to only ask whether such an element exists, use `any?`. To combine from last to first, `fold` the `reverse` of the list.

## 4. Reference definitions

The source of each library is the concatenation, in order, of the `lisp` code blocks in its section (4.1 for `list`, 4.2 for `text`, 4.3 for `function`, 4.4 for `map`, 4.5 for `set`). The definitions use only the core and the libraries they import. Parameter names avoid those of the primitives, such as `rest` and `count`, because a parameter with the same name would shadow the primitive inside the function. The order of the definitions does not matter: global names are resolved at call time.

### 4.1 `list`

#### Reduction and transformation

```lisp
(define fold
  (lambda (f acc xs)
    (if (empty? xs) acc
        otherwise (fold f (f acc (first xs)) (rest xs)))))

(define reverse
  (lambda (xs)
    (fold (lambda (acc x) (prepend x acc)) () xs)))

(define map
  (lambda (f xs)
    (reverse (fold (lambda (acc x) (prepend (f x) acc)) () xs))))

(define filter
  (lambda (keep? xs)
    (reverse (fold (lambda (acc x) (if (keep? x) (prepend x acc) otherwise acc))
                   () xs))))
```

#### Lists

```lisp
(define append
  (lambda (xs ys)
    (fold (lambda (r x) (prepend x r)) ys (reverse xs))))

(define take
  (lambda (wanted xs)
    (if (< wanted 0) (error "take: negative count" wanted)
        otherwise (reverse (take-step wanted xs ())))))

(define take-step
  (lambda (n xs acc)
    (if (or (= n 0) (empty? xs)) acc
        otherwise (take-step (- n 1) (rest xs) (prepend (first xs) acc)))))

(define drop
  (lambda (wanted xs)
    (if (< wanted 0) (error "drop: negative count" wanted)
        otherwise (if (or (= wanted 0) (empty? xs)) xs
                      otherwise (drop (- wanted 1) (rest xs))))))

(define range
  (lambda (start end)
    (range-step start end ())))

(define range-step
  (lambda (start n acc)
    (if (<= n start) acc
        otherwise (range-step start (- n 1) (prepend (- n 1) acc)))))
```

#### Search and sorting

```lisp
(define any?
  (lambda (matches? xs)
    (if (empty? xs) #false
        otherwise (if (matches? (first xs)) #true
                      otherwise (any? matches? (rest xs))))))

(define every?
  (lambda (matches? xs)
    (not (any? (lambda (x) (not (matches? x))) xs))))

(define sort
  (lambda (less? xs)
    (let ((size (count xs))
          (half (quotient size 2)))
      (if (< size 2) xs
          otherwise (merge-sorted less?
                                  (sort less? (take half xs))
                                  (sort less? (drop half xs))
                                  ())))))

(define merge-sorted
  (lambda (less? a b acc)
    (if (empty? a) (fold (lambda (r x) (prepend x r)) b acc)
        otherwise (if (empty? b) (fold (lambda (r x) (prepend x r)) a acc)
                      otherwise (if (less? (first b) (first a))
                                    (merge-sorted less? a (rest b) (prepend (first b) acc))
                                    otherwise (merge-sorted less? (rest a) b (prepend (first a) acc)))))))
```

### 4.2 `text`

```lisp
(import list)

(define join
  (lambda (separator parts)
    (if (empty? parts) ""
        otherwise (fold (lambda (acc part) (concatenate acc separator part))
                        (first parts) (rest parts)))))

(define split
  (lambda (separator text)
    (if (empty? separator) (error "split: empty separator")
        otherwise (reverse (split-step separator (count separator) text (count text)
                                       0 0 ())))))

(define split-step
  (lambda (separator width text limit start position acc)
    (if (> (+ position width) limit)
        (prepend (substring text start limit) acc)
        otherwise
        (if (equal? (substring text position (+ position width)) separator)
            (split-step separator width text limit (+ position width) (+ position width)
                        (prepend (substring text start position) acc))
            otherwise (split-step separator width text limit start (+ position 1) acc)))))
```

### 4.3 `function`

```lisp
(import list)

(define partial
  (lambda (f &rest fixed)
    (lambda (&rest more) (apply f (append fixed more)))))
```

### 4.4 `map`

Every function goes through `keys`, `get`, `associate` and `dissociate`, which are persistent (core 8.6), so each one costs time proportional to the size of the map times a logarithm, and runs in constant stack, like the functions of `list`.

```lisp
(import list)

(define values
  (lambda (m)
    (map (lambda (key) (get m key)) (keys m))))

(define entries
  (lambda (m)
    (map (lambda (key) (list key (get m key))) (keys m))))

(define from-entries
  (lambda (pairs)
    (fold (lambda (acc pair)
            (if (and (list? pair) (= (count pair) 2))
                (associate acc (first pair) (first (rest pair)))
                otherwise (error "from-entries: each entry must be a list (key value)" pair)))
          {} pairs)))

(define update
  (lambda (key f m)
    (associate m key (f (get m key)))))

(define merge
  (lambda (m other)
    (fold (lambda (acc key) (associate acc key (get other key))) m (keys other))))

(define map-values
  (lambda (f m)
    (fold (lambda (acc key) (associate acc key (f (get m key)))) m (keys m))))

(define filter-entries
  (lambda (keep? m)
    (fold (lambda (acc key) (if (keep? key (get m key)) acc otherwise (dissociate acc key)))
          m (keys m))))

(define fold-entries
  (lambda (f initial m)
    (fold (lambda (acc key) (f acc key (get m key))) initial (keys m))))
```

### 4.5 `set`

The functions build on `elements`, `adjoin`, `disjoin` and `contains?`, which are persistent (core 8.6).

```lisp
(import list)

(define from-list
  (lambda (xs)
    (fold adjoin #{} xs)))

(define union
  (lambda (a b)
    (fold adjoin a (elements b))))

(define intersection
  (lambda (a b)
    (fold (lambda (acc x) (if (contains? b x) acc otherwise (disjoin acc x)))
          a (elements a))))

(define difference
  (lambda (a b)
    (fold disjoin a (elements b))))

(define subset?
  (lambda (a b)
    (every? (lambda (x) (contains? b x)) (elements a))))
```

## 5. Conformance

The file `stdlib-conformance.json` has 46 cases, in the same format as the core `eval` cases, with one difference: the libraries `list`, `text`, `function`, `map` and `set` are available to `import`. Each program imports what it uses. An implementation that provides the library MUST pass all of them, in addition to the core cases.

The cases cover every function in section 3, the errors of `take`, `drop` and `split`, the two-list limit of `append`, the early exit of `any?`, the stability of `sort`, a program redefining a library name, a file included with a prefix that imports a library, a traversal of one hundred thousand elements, which only passes if the functions run in constant memory, every function of `map` with its errors, a map of one hundred thousand keys built with `from-entries` and reduced with `filter-entries`, every function of `set`, sets of one hundred thousand elements, and `import` itself: names unbound without it, prefixes, the dependencies of `text`, `function`, `map` and `set` on `list`, and repeated imports.
